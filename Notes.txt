Notes for the Ancient Robots event:

The sequence of events up to and including the point where the EVIL ROBOT ARMIES spawn works but has not been thoroughly debugged. Although some stuff has been coded after that point, I make no promises that it actually works.

Current KNOWN Issues:

> There is no limitation on your ability to recruit robot armies before they turn evil; you're supposed to max out at four.
> It's not clear if this is actually possible, but we'd like the appearance of the robot armies to turn off the planetary fortifications.
> An event should probably occur if you ignore the siege project for too long.

limit of recruited armies must work like the giant beasts
the second line must not neccessarily be done
we just need to tweak how strong the spawned armies are
and how many to spawn
this will need a lot of testing until it will feel right i think
hmm the last one i donÂ´t know if this is necessary
i thought about a malus for the colony as long as the crisis is ongoing
something like -100% science and minerals and energy
this should make the player deal with the problem as fast as possible and it fits the situation
